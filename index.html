			<h1 class="Description"> History of the House of Pizza </h1>

			<p> Southborough House of Pizza was founded in 1974 by Angelo and Joanna Baltas. It started out in a small location with only ten seats—one table with four chairs and six stools at a counter. Due to its quick popularity and success, it was necessary to move to the present location, in the town’s Old Fire Station in 1984. The founders renovated the Old Fire Station, keeping its original look and feel, preserving its place in the town’s history. Now in its third generation, the Baltas Family continues to own and operate Southborough House of Pizza, involving themselves in many town events and charities.
